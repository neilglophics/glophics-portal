/**
 * A message body, with its links clickable — and no HTML anywhere.
 *
 * ── How this keeps the escaping invariant ──
 *
 * Invariant 7 in CLAUDE.md, and the note at the top of the Bubble component, is
 * that everything a user types is escaped: chat is the whole XSS surface of this
 * app. "Make links clickable" is the classic reason people reach for
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and doing that here would hand one member's typing to
 * another member's DOM as markup.
 *
 * So `segments()` splits the body into text runs and links, and this maps them to
 * a string child or an `<a>`. **React escapes every one of them exactly as it did
 * when the body was a single text child.** There is no path from a message to
 * markup, and there must not be one.
 *
 * The `href` is separately validated: `safeHref` parses the URL and only http and
 * https survive, so a `javascript:` or `data:` URL renders as the text somebody
 * typed rather than as a link that runs in our origin.
